# Todo List App

This is a simple Todo List application built with React. It uses local storage to persist tasks and includes editing and deleting features.

## Features

- Add tasks with optional due dates and priority levels
- Edit, complete or delete tasks
- Filter tasks by **All**, **Active** or **Completed**
- Clear all completed tasks
- Persistent storage in the browser using `localStorage`
- Displays the number of active tasks remaining
- Search tasks by text
- Tasks are automatically sorted by priority and due date

## Running

Open `index.html` in your web browser. The page loads React from a CDN and should work without a build step.
